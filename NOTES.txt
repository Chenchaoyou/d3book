NOTES

Have tried everything to control the background color of code chunks as in myslidy.css (see d3 lectures folder) to no avail.  Gitbook appears to work differently.

I can control some things but not all.

Works:

  pre {
    font-size: 200%;
    font-weight: bold;
    width: 80%;
  }

  .sourceCode {
   font-size: 200%;
   width: 40%;
}

Doesn't work:

  pre {
    font-family: "Times New Roman";
    border-color: green;
    color: orange;
    background-color: green;
  }

This work for <div class="sourceCode"> not
<pre class="sourceCode">

.sourceCode {
   background-color: green;
}

FONT AWESOME

Use only 5.1.0 or earlier
