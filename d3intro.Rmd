## Selections

### Select by tag

The ability to select elements on a page is key to being able to manipulate them.  `d3.select()` will select the first match; `d3.selectAll()` will select all matches.

Chaining, similar to the tidyverse pipe operator `%>%`, allows us to act on the selected elements.  For example:

``` js
d3.select("circle");
```

selects the first circle in the order in which circles appear in the `<svg>` grouping. If there were more than one circle we could select them all with:

``` js
d3.selectAll("circle");
```

We can select HTML elements by tag in the same way:

``` js
d3.select("h1");
d3.selectAll("h1");
```

### Select by class
