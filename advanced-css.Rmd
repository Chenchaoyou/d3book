## Pseudoclasses

### :focus

Mainly used for tabbing. Clicking *may* focus a button but [not always](https://zellwk.com/blog/inconsistent-button-behavior/). A box shadow such as `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px lightskyblue;` is a [good choice](https://zellwk.com/blog/style-hover-focus-active-states/#styling-focus-states)
