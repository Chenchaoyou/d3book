# Introduction {#intro}

Prequisites for learning D3 include a basic understanding of: 

1. HTML -- the language of the web

2. CSS -- used for styling web pages, and more importantly for our purposes, selecting elements on a page or in a graphic

3. SVG -- the graphics format that we will be using

4. JavaScript -- language for making web pages interactive, animated, code is executed when page is opened or refreshed

As our focus is D3, not building complex web sites with multiple pages, we will learn minimal amounts of these technologies on a need to know basis.
