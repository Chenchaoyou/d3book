["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction Although it has plenty of new material and exercises, this book frequently references Scott Murray’s Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd edition, a required book for GR5702. As such this resource is more a supplement to IDVW2 rather than an alternative. IDVW2 is the gold standard for learning D3. You may be wondering, why do we need any extra material? Here’s why: IDVW2 is written for graphics designers not data science students so the pain points are somewhat different. As the title states, my intended audience is R users, though you certainly don’t need to know R to use this resource. IDVW2 does not use certain ES6 conventions which make coding easier (and more like R emo::ji(“star_struck”)). IDVW2 does not include examples involved advanced statistics. I prefer presenting some of the material in a different order than presented in IDVW2. None of this detracts from the fact that IDVW2 is absolutely essential to learning D3. Although we will consider different examples, you are encouraged to study the code examples in Murray’s text. "],

(There are other ways to open Chrome DevTools). Using the JavaScript Console to execute code, not necessarily connected with the current page. "],
