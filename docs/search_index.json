["introduction.html", "3 Introduction", " 3 Introduction This book is not designed to be a standalone resource but rather an accompaniment to Scott Murray’s Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd edition. IDVW2 is written for graphics designers not data science students so the pain points are somewhat different. In places where I recommend a different method from IDVW2, I will state so clearly. In particular we will, in general, use a later version of JavaScript, but feel free to use the book methods if you prefer. The new JavaScript is summarized here (add link). My examples are different though you are encouraged to read Murray’s examples as well and study his code. Material is organized slightly differently. Follow the order here – sections of IDVW2 will be referenced as relevant. "],
