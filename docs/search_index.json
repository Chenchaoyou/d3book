So you can see the benefits and know what you’re working toward when you get stuck in the weeds. Then we’ll go back and start learning step by step. 1.0.1 What you need Chrome browser 1.0.2 Elements Open a downloaded version of shapes.html. You can obtain a downloaded copy of the file by: clicking here and then File, Save Page As… or downloading a ZIP of the whole repo by clicking here or forking and cloning the repo Click View, Developer, Developer Tools, then the Elements tab. Hover the mouse over various elements in the &lt;body&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; section. Click the Console tab. Type d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;cx&quot;, &quot;200&quot;); at the prompt (&gt;), press enter and see what happens. Now try some of the following and/or experiment on your own with changing attributes of the circle: d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;cx&quot;, &quot;300&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;cx&quot;, &quot;400&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;cx&quot;, &quot;500&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;cx&quot;, &quot;600&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;cx&quot;, &quot;100&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;30&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;130&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;3&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;30&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;red&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;aliceblue&quot;); d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).attr(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;lightseagreen&quot;); Refresh the page. What happened? Go to Elements. Look at the value of the y1 attribute of the SVG &lt;line&gt; element. Go back to the Console and enter the following: d3.select(&quot;line&quot;).attr(&quot;y1&quot;, &quot;10&quot;); Go back to Elements and observe. What happened? Stay in Elements and refresh the page. What happened to y1? Now back to the Console to make style changes to the HTML elements: d3.select(&quot;h1&quot;).style(&quot;color&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;); d3.select(&quot;h2&quot;).style(&quot;font-size&quot;, &quot;50px&quot;); d3.select(&quot;h2&quot;).style(&quot;font-family&quot;, &quot;Impact&quot;); 1.0.3 Part B: Transitions (Ch. 9) Try these: d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).transition().duration(2000).attr(&quot;cx&quot;, &quot;400&quot;); d3.select(&quot;ellipse&quot;).transition().duration(2000).attr(&quot;transform&quot;, &quot;translate (400, 400)&quot;); d3.select(&quot;line&quot;).transition().duration(2000).attr(&quot;x1&quot;, &quot;400&quot;); d3.select(&quot;line&quot;).transition().duration(2000).attr(&quot;y1&quot;, &quot;250&quot;); d3.select(&quot;p&quot;).transition().duration(2000).style(&quot;font-size&quot;, &quot;72px&quot;); Experiment with more transitions. 1.0.4 Part C: Interactivity (Ch. 10) Set up a function to turn the fill color to yellow: function goyellow() {d3.select(this).attr(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;)}; Add an event listener to the circle that will be trigger a call to goyellow() on a mouseover: d3.select(&quot;circle&quot;).on(&quot;mouseover&quot;, goyellow); Test it out. Add the same event listener to the ellipse. Test it out. Create a function goblue() that changes the fill color to blue. Add event listeners to the circle and ellipse that will trigger a call to goblue() on a mouseout. Test out your code. Try out a click event. (Note the use of an anonymous function.) d3.select(&quot;line&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {d3.select(this).attr(&quot;stroke-width&quot;, &quot;10&quot;);}); Try another click event. What’s happening? d3.select(&quot;svg&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {d3.select(&quot;text&quot;).text(`(${d3.mouse(this)})`)}); "],
["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction Although it has plenty of new material and exercises, this book frequently references Scott Murray’s Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd edition, a required book for GR5702. As such this resource is more a supplement to IDVW2 rather than an alternative. IDVW2 is the gold standard for learning D3. You may be wondering, why do we need any extra material? Here’s why: IDVW2 is written for graphics designers not data science students so the pain points are somewhat different. As the title states, my intended audience is R users, though you certainly don’t need to know R to use this resource. IDVW2 does not use certain ES6 conventions which make coding easier (and more like R!) IDVW2 does not include examples involved advanced statistics. I prefer presenting some of the material in a different order than presented in IDVW2. None of this detracts from the fact that IDVW2 is absolutely essential to learning D3. Although we will consider different examples, you are encouraged to study Murray’s code examples in addition to reading the text. "],

(There are other ways to open Chrome DevTools). Using the JavaScript Console to execute code, not necessarily connected with the current page. "],
